# ESP8266-GPIO-Usage

ESP8266 - For Hobby Stuff and System Engineering Course - CTIS477

All Diagrams are made by me and are tested before i upload.

### Project Idea

This project is made to be used in our University course CTIS-477 - System Engineering.
For this course we have to make a small **Smart Home Automation System** as such i have decided to do the following;

Have a dashboard panel accessible by a web browser and will use 3 sensors:
Motion Sensor,
LDR Sensor,
Temperature and Humidity Combo Sensor.
So what will these sensors do?

- Motion Sensor
  - This sensor will send alerts to the dashboard and activate the LED connected to the circuit.

- LDR Sensor
  - When the room becomes dark, the sensor will send a query to the dashboard and activate a motor (i assume that this is connected to a curtain or something.) and activate the LED connected to the circuit.

- Temperature and Humidity Combo Sensor
  - The data will be simply displayed in the dashboard.

- LED
  - From the dashboard the user will be able to open and close the LED connected to the circuit.

- Motor
  - From the dashboard the user will be able to activate the motor. To a certain degree.
